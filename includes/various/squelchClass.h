//
//	just a simple class to include elementary squelch handling
//	The basic idea is that when there is no signal, the noise
//	in the upper bands will be roughly as high as in the lowerbands.
//	Measurement shows that the average amplitude of the noise in the
//	upper band is roughly 0.6 times that of the lower part.
//	If the average signal value of the upper part is larger
//	than factor times the average signal value of the lower part,
//	where factor is a value between 0 .. 1, set by the user.
